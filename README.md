# JJ Wedding Site

I built a random question generator site for my friends upcoming wedding!

This is a Typescript / React web app that will be run in a Safari browser on an iPad. It is configured to look and feel like a native IOS app. A user can click on the dice icon to generate a new random question to use in a video confessional.

The logo & designs are proprietary to GoodTimes.
